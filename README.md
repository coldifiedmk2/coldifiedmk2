# Hi!

I'm coldified_.  

I do random stuffs:  
I'm an Arch Linux user. (btw)  
I torture myself with an Nvidia GPU.  
I sometimes listen to musics and play some games. :D  
I occasionally do 3D/2D Graphics as a hobby.

### What I like
I LOVE open-source projects.  
I LOVE small/indie content creators.
